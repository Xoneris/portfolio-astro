## Short description
The backend I created for the [Metroidvania.GG frontend](/1-metroidvaniagg-frontend). My first project I used a backend framework. Steep learning curve at the start with getting started with the MVC/MVT model, migrations and how to create a RESTful api.  


## Learnings
First major project I used Django for. I learned to use all the basics of Django: 
- Create a REST api.
- Use the MVC/MVT model.
- Using an ORM.
- Creating a model and using migrations.
