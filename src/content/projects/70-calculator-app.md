## Short description
Just a small calculator app made with Svelte. Doesn't look special on first glance, but a lot of work went into making sure that you can only input valid characters. An equal amount of work also went into making sure the actual calculation is correct. Looks simple on first glance but a lot of stuff is going on under the hood.

## Learnings
Just a small Svelte app. I learned some of the basics of Svelte:
- How reactivity works.
- How Svelte components are split up.
- How to make a calculator without using eval()
