## Short description
A small tool I created for my friends and me. Helldivers 2 is an action videogame where you fight against giant bugs and evil robots in space. On every mission you can select a loadout to take with you. We wanted to challenge ourselfs and see how well we would do if our loadout was random. So I thought that be a good challenge for me.

## Learnings
Second project I used React. I was able to deepen my understanding of React: 
- Learning the difference between useState and useRef and when to use which one. 
- Creating a complex algorithem to randomise
- Learning various Javascript features that have to do with Arrays.
- Creating multiple options that influence the outcome, while still creating a reliable result.
