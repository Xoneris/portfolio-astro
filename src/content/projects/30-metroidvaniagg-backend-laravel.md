## Short description
Laravel is a backend framework I wanted to tryout and learn for a while now. As a first excersise I thought just replicating the functionality of my Django backend would be good learning experience. To me personally working with Laravel felt more intuitive than Django, so I decided to eventually migrate the entire backend from Django to Laravel. I'm not quite there yet, though. Therefore this is still a work in progress.

## Learnings
First major project I used Laravel for. I learned to use all the basics of Laravel: 
- Using the artisan tool.
- Learn Blade template syntax.
- Create a REST api.
- Use the MVC/MVT model.
- Using an ORM.
- Creating a model and using migrations.
