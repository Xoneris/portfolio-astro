## Short description
[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) is a website where developers can test their skills. They have a variety of different challanges ranging from easy to expert. If you start a challenge, you will be given a Figma file and the goal is to recreate the website with all it's functionality from the Figma file. It's up to you which technologies and tools you use. 

For this challenge I used Angular and Tailwind CSS. So far this is only a frontend project with no backend or database functionality. But that is something I could add at some later point stage if I wanted. 

## Learnings
First major project I used Angular for. I learned the following:
- The basics of Angular
- Creating and using Angular components
- How to use Modals in Angular
- Reactivity in Angular
