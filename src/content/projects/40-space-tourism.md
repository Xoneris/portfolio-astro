## Short description
[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) is a website where developers can test their skills. They have a variety of different challanges ranging from easy to expert. If you start a challenge, you will be given a Figma file and the goal is to recreate the website with all it's functionality from the Figma file. It's up to you which technologies and tools you use. 

For this specific challenge I choose Vue.js and Sass, since both of these technologies are something I wanted to experiment and learn more. I believe Vue.js was overkill for this sort of website, but a good learning experience none the less. 

## Learnings
First major project I used Vue.js and Sass for. I learned to use some the basics of Vue and Sass: 
- How to use Vue components.
- The difference between setup and composition api.
- Basic state management in Vue with Ref's. 
- Using variables in Sass.
- How to nest in Sass.
