## Short description
My passion project. Metroidvania.GG is a information hub website for the subgenre of videogames called 'Metroidvanias.' Most 'Metroidvanias' are created by small teams or just a single developer. The main goal of this website is to signalboost all these niche games for all the fans of this subgenre. 

The website itself is made with Laravel on the backend and Inertia and React for the frontend. I'm using a SQLite database which I'm hosting on my own VPS on DigitalOcean.
