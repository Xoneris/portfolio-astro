### Work In Progress
This project is currently **NOT** finished and I'm still actively working on it. Therefore a lot of things are not working properly. There is also no public demo yet. 


## Short description
[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) is a website where developers can test their skills. They have a variety of different challanges ranging from easy to expert. If you start a challenge, you will be given a Figma file and the goal is to recreate the website with all it's functionality from the Figma file. It's up to you which technologies and tools you use. 


For this challenge I used Next.js, Drizzle, PostgreSQL and Tailwind CSS. I've been meaning to create a project with Next.js for a while. Drizzle I choose, because I heard it's a newer "cooler" alternative to Prisma, so I wanted to see for myself. And Tailwind I just used because I love working with it. 

## Learnings
First major project I used Next.js, Drizzle and PostgreSQL for. I learned the following:
- Next.js Client and Server component difference
- Basics of the app router
- Server actions
- How to use Modals for User Experience
- How to create a Dark Mode toggle Button
- How to connect to a DB with Drizzle
- How to create a schema in Drizzle
- How to perform crude operations in Drizzle
